## Report:

### Challenges you faced during the implementation:
Ans: I require to learn about SSD and other object detection methods. I choosed SSD for this project. And Used resnet50 as a backbone.

### How you used AI tools to help with coding
Ans: To understand SSD and architecture and I used online blogs available to understand so used tool to debug and understand particular part of code.

### What you learned from the project
Ans: New Object detection methods


### What surprised you about the process
Ans: I was surprised that I dont had any idea that methods like SSD, FPN, RPN etc are there for object detection.

### How do you feel about the balance between writing code yourself vs. using AI assistence.
Ans: OK

### Suggestions for improving this assignment 
Ans: Assignment can be improved in such a way that you can ask either we have to do multi-class object detection or single class. Appart from this assignment after i learned SSD and i am working on multi-class object detection. Contains indoor objects like table, chair, cupboard etcssss
